HOW IT WORKS:

This is a random password generator. When the user first comes to the webpage they will enter a series of prompt windows
that will help define which types of characters they want to use and how long they want the password to be.

The user may choose from the following character types: Lower-case letters, Upper-case letters, Numbers, and Special characters.
The user will enter "yes" or "no" for these as a response, and if something other than those is entered they will be redirected 
to the question again. Capitilization will not effect the validity of the response.

The user will then be asked to give a number between 8 and 128. If something other than this is entered they will be redirected to
the question again. 

Once the prompts have been properly answered, the user will now have acess to the webpage proper. From here they will see
a password generated that matches the perameters given. There are also two buttons below that will generate a new password
with the same given perameters, or they can copy the password to the clipboard.

This link is an example of what the webpage should look like after the prompts have been answered:
